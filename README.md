# Behaviors for Personality Insights
## DEPRECATED: This module was supersed by the new Personality Insights v3 API

Obtain behaviors from Personality Insights' profiles. Behaviors present in this component are based on scientific research.

## Getting Started

1. Require and instance `personality-behaviors` component

  ```JavaScript
  const PersonalityBehaviors = require('personality-behaviors');
  const personalityBehaviors = new PersonalityBehaviors({ locale: 'es' });
  ```

2. Get profile's behavior

  ```JavaScript
  const profile = require('./resources/profile');
  const behaviors = personalityBehaviors.behaviors(profile);
  ```
  
3. Render behaviors somewhere! Try rendering them as cards!

See the complete [example code][example_code] or [try it live][live_example]

## More Features

There are more features available such as:

- Including the component as a browser script. Component will be exported as the global variable `PersonalityBehaviors`.

- Filtering behaviors by category, industry or both!
```JavaScript
const financeBehaviors = personalityBehaviors.behaviors(profile, { category: ['finance'] });
const mediaBehaviors = personalityBehaviors.behaviors(profile, { industry: ['media'] });
```

- Get category and industry listings
```JavaScript
const industries = personalityBehaviors.industries();
const categories = personalityBehaviors.categories();
```

- Formatting descriptions in html or markdown optionally!
```JavaScript
const personalityBehaviors = new PersonalityBehaviors({ format:'html' });
const mediaBehaviors = personalityBehaviors.behaviors(profile, { industry: ['media'] });
```
